## smART

smART is an App that shows you art you did not know before. You see works of art
that you can save or skip as you are familiar with from other apps.

I developed this app as my capstone project of the Neue Fische Web Development
Bootcamp.

## You find the demo version [here](https://capstone-app.vercel.app/)
